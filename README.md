Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

This project explores how to predict future cryptocurrency prices using deep learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Historical weekly Bitcoin price data was pulled from the Kraken exchange API and use to train a mdoel that forecasts future prices.

## Overview

- Time Series Forecasting with LSTM
- Dataset: Kraken OHLC Weekly Data (XBT/USD)
- Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Kera, Pandas, Matplotlib
